# SQL Server Management Studio - Changelog (SSMS)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

This article provides details about updates, improvements, and bug fixes for the current and previous versions of SSMS. Download [previous SSMS versions](#previous-ssms-releases).


## [SSMS 18.0 (RC1)](download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md)

Build number: 15.0.18098.0<br>
Release date: March 28, 2019

Release Candidate 1 (RC1) is our latest public preview of SSMS 18.0. For the latest General Availability (GA) version of SSMS, [download and install SSMS 17.9.1](#ssms-1791-latest-ga-release).

### What's new in RC1

This section lists what's new in SSMS 18.0 RC1. For a complete changelog since SSMS 17.9.1, see [SSMS 18.0 Preview - cumulative changelog through RC1](#ssms-180-preview---cumulative-changelog-through-rc1).

**SSMS Improvements**

- Enabling XMLA endpoint connectivity to PowerBI datasets. XMLA endpoints provide access to the Analysis Services engine in the Power BI Service. This allows tools such as SSMS and SQL Profiler to connect to Power BI datasets for monitoring, management, debugging, etc. For details, see [XMLA endpoint connectivity](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085204).

- **SMO**
  - Added cascade delete support to "Edge Constraints" in both SMO and SSMS.
  - Added support for data classification "read-write" permissions.

- **Audit Files**
  - Updated list of known audit actions to include FEATURE RESTRICTION ADD/CHANGE GROUP/DROP.

### Bug fixes

- **General SSMS**
  - Fixed an issue which was preventing MFA authentication when user ids belonged to multiple tenants.
  - Fixed an issue where the Perf Dashboard Report was reporting PAGELATCH and PAGEIOLATCH waits that could not found in subreports.

- **SSMS Editor**
  - Fixed an issue where several system views and table values functions were not properly colorized.

- **Object Explorer**
  - Added proper escaping in Object Explorer filtering. For details, see [Azure feedback 36678803](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035/suggestions/36678803).

- **SMO**
  - Fixed an issue where GetDbComparer was incorrectly defaulting the collation to CI for ALL Azure DBs.

- **Managed Instance support**
  - Improved display of Managed Instances server specific properties (hardware generation, service tier, storage used and reserved).

- **Azure SQL Database**
  - Fixed issue where Service Level Objectives (SLO) were hardcoded, making it harder for SSMS to support newer SQL Azure SLOs. Now users can sign in to Azure and allow SSMS to retrieve all the applicable SLO data (Edition and Max Size).

- **Result Grid**
  - Fixed an issue which resulted in an "Index out of range" exception when clicking on the grid.
  - Fixed an issue where the grid result background color was being ignored. For details, see [Azure feedback 32895916](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035/suggestions/32895916).

- **Profiler**
  - Fixed issue that was preventing the SQL Profiler from starting on Windows 7 SP1.

- **ShowPlan**
  - Add the following 4 attributes in RunTimeCountersPerThread of actual execution xml plan: HpcRowCount (Number of rows processed by hpc device), HpcKernelElapsedUs (elapsed time wait for kernel execution in use), HpcHostToDeviceBytes (bytes transferred from host to device), and HpcDeviceToHostBytes (bytes transferred from device to host).

- **Data-tier Application Wizard**
  - Fixed an issue where the user was not able to import a Data-tier Application (.dacpac) due to limited access to the server (e.g. no access to all the databases on the same server).
  - Fixed an issue which was causing the import to be extremely slow when many databases happened to be hosted on the same Azure SQL server.

### Deprecated Features

- Removed Static Data Masking (preview) feature.

### Known issues

- N/A

## SSMS 18.0 preview - cumulative changelog through RC1

If there is no *preview 5*, *preview 6*, *preview 7*, or *RC1* label it indicates the change appeared in our first public preview of SSMS 18.0, which was SSMS 18.0 *preview 4*.

### What's new

- **SSMS**
  - Smaller Download Size
    - The current size of the bundle is less than half of what SSMS 17.x is (~400 MB). The size will eventually grow a little when the IS components are added back to SSMS, but it should not be as large as it used to be.
  - SSMS is based on the new VS 2017 Isolated Shell
    - This means a modern shell (we picked up VS 2017 15.6.4). The new shell unlocks all the accessibility fixes that went in both SSMS and Visual Studio.
  - SSMS accessibility improvements
    - Much work went in to address Accessibility issues in all the tools (SSMS, DTA, and Profiler)
  - SSMS can be installed in custom folder
    - Currently, this is only available on the command-line setup. Pass this extra argument to the SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe:
      - SSMSInstallRoot=C:\MySSMS18
      - By default, the new install location for SSMS is:
      - %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18\Common7\IDE\ssms.exe
      - Note: this does not mean what SSMS is multi-instance.
  - SSMS does not share components with SQL Engine anymore
    - Much effort went in to avoid sharing components with SQL Engine, which often resulted in serviceability issues (one clobbering the files installed by the other.
  - SSMS requires NetFx 4.7.2 or greater
    - We upgraded our minimum requirement from NetFx4.6.1 to NetFx4.7.2: this will allow us to take advantage of the new functionality exposed by the new framework.
  - SSMS not supported on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012; Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 will require at least version 1607 (10.0.14393)
    - Due to the new dependency on NetFx 4.7.2, SSMS 18.0 does not install on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 and older versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. SSMS setup will block on those OSes. Note: "Windows 8.1" is still supported.
  - SSMS is not added to the PATH environment variable
    - Path to SSMS.EXE (and Tools in general) is not added to the path anymore. The users can either add it themselves or, if on a modern Windows, rely on the Start menu.
  - Support for SQL Server SQL2019
    - This is the first release of SSMS that would be fully aware of SQL Server 2019 (compatLevel 150, etc…)
    - Support "BATCH_STARTED_GROUP" and "BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP" in SQLSERVER2018 and managed instance in SSMS
    - SMO support for UDF Inlining
    - GraphDB: Add flag in showplan for Graph TC Sequence
    - Always Encrypted: added support for AEv2 / Enclave
    - Always Encrypted: connection dialog has a new tab "Always Encrypted" when the user clicks on the "Options" button to enable/configure Enclave support.
  - Package IDs no longer needed to develop SSMS Extensions
    - In the past, SSMS was selectively loading only well-known packages, thus requiring developers to register their own package. This is no longer the case.
  - Support for High DPI is enabled by default
  - Better Azure SQL Database support
  - SLO/Edition/MaxSize database properties now accept custom names, making it easier to support future editions of SQL Azure databases
  - Added support for recently added vCore SKUs (General Purpose and Business Critical): Gen4_24 and all the Gen5.
  - Exposing AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES config option  for Filegroups in SSMS
  - Removed risky 'lightweight pooling' and 'priority boost' options from SSMS GUI (For details, see https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/arvindsh/2010/01/26/priority-boost-details-and-why-its-not-recommended/)
  - SQL Editor honors the CTRL+D shortcut to duplicate lines (For details, see https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32896594)
  - New menu and key bindings to creates files: CTRL+ALT+N. CTRL+N will continue to create a new query. Note: if you are migrating from "SSMS 18.0 Preview 1", you must reset the user settings from "**Tools | Import Export Settings | Reset all settings**".
  - "New Firewall Rule" dialog now allow the user to specify a rule name, instead of automatically generating one on behalf of the user (For details, see https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32902039)=
  - Data Classification: updated the recommendations
  - Improved intellisense in Editor especially for v140 T-SQL
  - Added support in SSMS UI for UTF-8 on collation dialog.
  - Switched to "Windows Credential Manager" for connection dialog MRU passwords. This will address a long outstanding issue where persistence of passwords was not always reliable. For details, see https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32896486.
  - Improved support for multi-monitor systems by making sure that more and more dialogs and windows pop up on the expected monitor.
  - Exposed the 'backup checksum default' server configuration in the new Database Settings page of the Server Properties Dialog. For details, see https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/34634974
  - [New in Preview 5] Exposed "maximum size for error log files" under "Configure SQL Server Error Logs". For details, see  https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035/suggestions/33624115 
  - [New in Preview 6] Added "Migrate to Azure" under Tools menu – We have integrated [Database Migration Assistant](https://aka.ms/get-dma) and [Azure Database Migration Service](https://aka.ms/get-dms) to provide quick and easy access to help accelerate your migrations to Azure.
  - [New in Preview 6] Previous version of SSMS 18.0 (< Preview 6) had the "Available Databases" key shortcut bound to **CTRL+ALT+J**. In Preview 6 and later, the key binding has been restored to **CTRL+U**, like it was in SSMS 17.x.
  - [New in Preview 6] Added logic to prompt the user to commit open transactions when "Change connection" is used.
  - [New in Preview 7] Added support for `UTF8_BIN2` collation.

- **SMO**

  - Added logic to display the "Materializer Operator (External Select)"
  - Add new showplan attribute BatchModeOnRowStoreUsed to easily identify queries that are using the " batch-mode scan on rowstores" feature. Anytime a query performs batch-mode scan on rowstores, a new attribute (BatchModeOnRowStoreUsed="true") gets added to StmtSimple element.
  - [New in Preview 7] Added Showplan support to LocalCube RelOp for `DW ROLLUP` and `CUBE`.

- **Database Compatibility Level Upgrade**
  - [New in Preview 5] Added a new option under <Database name> -> Tasks -> Database Upgrade. This will start the new Query Tuning Assistant (QTA) to guide the user through the process of:
    - Collecting a performance baseline before upgrading the database compatibility level. 
    - Upgrading to the desired database compatibility level
    - Collecting a 2nd pass of performance data over the same workload.
    - Detect workload regressions, and provide tested recommendations to improve workload performance.

    This is close to the database upgrade process documented in [Keep performance stability during the upgrade to newer SQL Server](../relational-databases/performance/query-store-usage-scenarios.md#CEUpgrade), except for the last step where QTA does not rely on a previously known good state to generate recommendations.

- **Query Store**

### What's new

**General SSMS**

ShowPlan:

- Graphical Showplan now shows the new row mode memory grant feedback attributes when the feature is activated for a specific plan: IsMemoryGrantFeedbackAdjusted and LastRequestedMemory added to the MemoryGrantInfo query plan XML element. For more on row mode memory grant feedback, For details, see [Adaptive query processing in SQL databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/adaptive-query-processing).

- Added support for vCore SKUs in Azure DB creation. For more information, For details, see [vCore-based purchasing model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-service-tiers#vcore-based-purchasing-model).
 

### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**
	
Replication Monitor:

- Fixed an issue that was causing Replication Monitor (SqlMonitor.exe) not to start (User Voice item: https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/34791079).

Import Flat File Wizard:

- Fixed the link to the help page for "Flat File Wizard" dialog 
- Fixed issue where the wizard did not allow changing the destination table when the table already existed: this allows users to retry without having to exit the wizard, delete the failed table, and then reenter the information into the wizard (User Voice item: https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32896186).

Import/Export Data-Tier Application:

- Fixed an issue (in DacFx) which was causing the import of a .bacpac could fail with a message like "Error SQL72014: .Net SqlClient Data Provider: Msg 9108, Level 16, State 10, Line 1 This type of statistics is not supported to be incremental. " when dealing with tables with partitions defined and no indexes on the table.

Intellisense:

- Fixed an issue where intellisense completion was not working when using AAD with MFA.

Object Explorer:

- Fixed an issue where the "Filter Dialog" was displayed on random monitors instead of the monitor where SSMS was running (multi-monitor systems).

Azure SQL:

- Fixed an issue related to enumeration of databases in the "Available Databases" where "master" was not displayed in the dropdown when connected to a specific database.
- Fixed an issue where trying to generate a script ("Data" or "Schema and Data") was failing then connected to the Azure SQL Database using AAD with MFA.
- Fixed an issue in the View Designer (Views) where it was not possible to select "Add Tables" from the UI when connected to a Azure SQL Database.
- Fixed an issue where SSMS Query Editor was silently closing and reopening connections during MFA token renewal. This prevents side effects unbeknownst to the user (like closing a transaction and never reopening again) from happening. The change adds the token expiration time to the properties window. 
- Fixed an issue where SSMS was not enforcing password prompts for imported MSA accounts for AAD with MFA login. 

Activity Monitor: 

- Fixed an issue that was causing "Live Query Statistics" to hang when launched from Activity Monitor and SQL Authentication was used. 

Microsoft Azure integration: 

- Fixed an issue where SSMS only shows the first 50 subscriptions (Always Encrypted dialogs, Backup/Restore from URL dialogs, etc...). 
- Fixed an issue where SSMS was throwing an exception ("Index out of range") while trying to sign in to a Microsoft Azure account that did not have any storage account (in Restore Backup from URL dialog). 

Object Scripting: 

- When scripting "Drop and Create", SSMS now avoids generating dynamic T-SQL.
- When scripting a database object, SSMS now does not generate script to set database scoped configurations, if they are set to default values.

Help:

- Fixed a long outstanding issue where "Help on Help" was not honoring the online/offline mode.
- When clicking on "Help | Community Projects and Samples" SSMS now opens the default browser that points to a Git page and shows no errors/warnings due to old browser being used.

### Known issues


> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using *Active Directory - Universal with MFA Support* authentication with the SQL query editor, users may experience their connection being closed and reopened with each query invocation. Side effects of such closure include global temporary tables being dropped unexpectedly and sometimes a new SPID being given to the connection. This closure will not occur if there is an open transaction on the connection. To work around this issue, users can set `persist security info=true` in the connection parameters.

*A bug was discovered in 17.8 related to provisioning SQL databases, so SSMS 17.8.1 replaces 17.8.*

Build number: 14.0.17277.0<br>
Release date: June 26, 2018

[Chinese (Simplified)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x804) | [Chinese (Traditional)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x404) | [English (United States)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x409) | [French](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x40c) | [German](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x407) | [Italian](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x410) | [Japanese](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x411) | [Korean](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x412) | [Portuguese (Brazil)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x416) | [Russian](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x419) | [Spanish](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=875802&clcid=0x40a)


### What's new

**General SSMS**

Database Properties:

- This improvement exposes the **AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES** configuration option for Filegroups. This new config option is added under the Database Properties > Filegroups window in the form of a new column (Autogrow All Files) of checkboxes for each available Filegroup (except for Filestream and Memory Optimized Filegroups). The user can enable/disable AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES for a particular Filegroup by toggling the corresponding Autogrow_All_Files checkbox. Correspondingly, the **AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES** option is properly scripted when scripting the database for CREATE / generating scripts for the database (SQL2016 and above).
	
SQL Editor:

- Improved experience with Intellisense in Azure SQL Database when the user doesn't have master access.

Scripting:

- General performance improvements, especially over high-latency connections.
	
**Analysis Services (AS)**

- Analysis Services client libraries and data providers updated to the latest version, which added support for the new Azure Government AAD authority (login.microsoftonline.us).



### Bug fixes

**General SSMS**
	
Maintenance Plans:

- Fixed an issue when editing maintenance plans with Sql Authentication where "Notify Operator Task" was failing when using SQL authentication.
	
Scripting:

- Fixed an issue where PostProcess actions in SMO lead to resource exhaustion and SQL login failures
	
SMO:

- Fixed an issue where Table.Alter() fails if adding a column with a default constraint and the table already has data. For details, see [sql server smo generating inline default constraint when adding a column to a table containing data](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/32895625).
	
Always Encrypted:

- Fixed an issue (in DacFx) which was causing a lock timeout error when enabling Always Encrypted on a partitioned table
	

**Analysis Services (AS)**

- Fixed an issue that occurred when modifying an OAuth datasource in a Tabular Analysis Services 1400-level compatibility model, which caused the changes in the OAuth tokens to not get updated in the data source.
- Fixed a crash in SSMS that may have occurred when using some invalid data source credentials or editing data sources that didn't support Change Data Source migration in Power Query (for example, Oracle) in Analysis Services Tabular 1400-level compatibility models.


### Known issues

- Clicking the *Script* button after modifying any filegroup property in the *Properties* window, generates two scripts - one script with a *USE <database>* statement, and a second script with a *USE master* statement.  The script with *USE master* is generated in error and should be discarded. Run the script that contains the *USE <database>* statement.
- Some dialogs display an invalid edition error when working with new *General Purpose* or *Business Critical* Azure SQL Database editions.
- Some latency in XEvents viewer may be observed. This is a [known issue in the .Net Framework](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/master/releases/net472/dotnet472-changes.md#sql). Consider upgrading to NetFx 4.7.2.




## ![download](../ssdt/media/download.png) [SSMS 17.7](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126)

Build number: 14.0.17254.0<br>
Release date: May 09, 2018

[Chinese (Simplified)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x804) | [Chinese (Traditional)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x404) | [English (United States)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x409) | [French](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x40c) | [German](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x407) | [Italian](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x410) | [Japanese](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x411) | [Korean](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x412) | [Portuguese (Brazil)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x416) | [Russian](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x419) | [Spanish](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=873126&clcid=0x40a)


### What's new

**General SSMS**

Replication Monitor:   
- Replication monitor now supports registering a listener for scenarios where publisher database and/or distributor database is part of Availability Group. You can now monitor replication environments where publisher database and/or distribution database is part of Always On. 
 
Azure SQL Data Warehouse: 
- Add Rejected Row Location support for External Tables in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. 

**Integration Services (IS)**

- Added a scheduling feature for SSIS packages deployed to Azure SQL Database. Unlike SQL Server on premises and SQL Database Managed Instance, which have SQL Server Agent as a first-class job scheduler, SQL Database does not have a built-in scheduler. This new SSMS feature provides a familiar user interface that's similar to SQL Server Agent for scheduling packages deployed to SQL Database. If you're using SQL Database to host the SSIS catalog database, SSISDB, you can use this SSMS feature to generate the Data Factory pipelines, activities, and triggers required to schedule SSIS packages. You can then edit and extend these objects in Data Factory. For more info, For details, see [Schedule SSIS package execution on Azure SQL Database with SSMS](../integration-services/lift-shift/ssis-azure-schedule-packages-ssms.md). To learn more about Azure Data Factory pipelines, activities, and triggers, For details, see [Pipelines and activities in Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipelines-activities) and [Pipeline execution and triggers in Azure Data Factory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/concepts-pipeline-execution-triggers).
- Support for SSIS package scheduling in SQL Agent on SQL Managed instance. It is now possible to create SQL Agent jobs to execute SSIS packages on the managed instance. 

### Bug fixes

**General SSMS** 

Maintenance Plan:   
- Fixed an issue where trying to change the schedule of an existing Maintenance Plan was throwing an exception. For details, see [SSMS 17.6 crashes when clicking on a schedule in a maintenance plan](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/33712924).

Always On: 
- Fixed an issue where Always On Latency Dashboard was not working with SQL Server 2012.

- Fixed issue where  SSMS crashes then trying to connect to a server, after opting out of sending telemetry.
 
Azure SQL Database: 
- Fixed an issue  where the user was not able to set or change compatibility level (the drop-down from empty). Note: in order to set the compatibility level to 150, the user still needs to use the *Script* button and manually edit the script. 
 
SMO: 
- Exposed Error Log Size setting in SMO. For details, see [Set the Maximum Size of the SQL Server Error Logs](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035-sql-server/suggestions/33624115).  
- Fix linefeed scripting in SMO on Linux.
- Miscellaneous perf improvement when retrieving rarely used properties.  

Intellisense: 
- Perf improvement: reduced volume of intellisense queries for column data. This is especially beneficial when working on tables with huge number of columns. 

SSMS User settings:
- Fixed an issue where the options page was not resizing properly.

Misc:  
- Improved how text is displayed on *Statistics details* page. 

**Integration Services (IS)**

 For more information on the Active Directory authentication methods, For details, see [Universal Authentication with SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse (SSMS support for MFA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-ssms-mfa-authentication) and [Configure Azure SQL Database multi-factor authentication for SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-ssms-mfa-authentication-configure).

- Output window has entries for queries run during expansion of Object Explorer nodes
- Enabled View designer Azure SQL Databases
- The default scripting options for scripting objects from Object Explorer in SSMS have changed:
  - Previously, the default on a new install was to have the generated script target the latest version of SQL Server (currently SQL Server 2017).
  - In SSMS 17.2 a new option has been added: *Match Script Settings to Source*. When set to *True*, the generated script targets the same version, engine type, and engine edition as the server the object being scripted is from.
  - The *Match Script Settings to Source* value is set to *True* by default, so new installs of SSMS will automatically default to always scripting objects to the same target as the original server.
  - When the *Match Script Settings to Source* value is set to *False*, the normal scripting target options will be enabled and function as they did previously.
Additionally, all the scripting options have been moved to their own section - *Version Options*. They are no longer under *General Scripting Options*.

- Added support for National Clouds in "Restore from URL"
- QueryStoreUI reports now supports additional metrics (RowCount, DOP, CLR Time etc.) from sys.query_store_runtime_stats.

### Known issues in this release:

- Query windows using "Active Directory - Universal with MFA Support" authentication may experience an error similar to the following, when attempting to execute a query after being open for one hour:

   `Msg 0, Level 11, State 0, Line 0
The connection is broken and recovery is not possible. The client driver attempted to recover the connection one or more times and all attempts failed. Increase the value of ConnectRetryCount to increase the number of recovery attempts.`

   Rerunning the query should get past the error and succeed.

- The following SSMS functionality is not supported for Azure AD auth using Universal Authentication with MFA:
  - The **New Table/View** designer shows the old-style login prompt, and does not work for Azure AD authentication.
  - The **Edit Top 200 Rows** feature doesn't support Azure Ad authentication.
  - The **Registered Server** component does not support Azure AD authentication.
  - The **Database Engine Tuning Advisor** is not supported for Azure AD authentication. There is a known issue where the error message presented to the user is less than helpful: *Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory,...* instead of the expected *Database Engine Tuning Advisor does not support Microsoft Azure SQL Database. (DTAClient)*.

**Analysis Services (AS)**

- Object Explorer in SSAS will not show the Windows Auth username in AS Azure connection properties.

## Uninstall and reinstall SSMS 17.x

If your SSMS installation is having problems, and a standard uninstall and reinstall doesn't resolve them, you can first try [repairing](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028054/windows-10-repair-or-remove-programs) the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell. If repairing the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell doesn't resolve the problem, the following steps have been found to fix many random issues:

1.	Uninstall SSMS the same way you uninstall any application (using *Apps & features*, *Programs and features*, etc. depending on your version of Windows).

2.	Uninstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:
   
    ```PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"```

    ```vs_isoshell.exe /Uninstall /Force /PromptRestart```

3.	Uninstall Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable the same way you uninstall any application. Uninstall both x86 and x64 if they're on your computer.

4.	Reinstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:  

    ```PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"```  
 
    ```vs_isoshell.exe /PromptRestart```
